# Trial task for frontend developer

In this trial task, you are asked to create an application that provides a simple create-and-retrieve interface for a cars inventory. The application is required to be designed as an SPA based on React.JS. The application must feature a grid suitable to represent a paged sorted list of cars (total number of cars in the inventory might exceed 10000 items). Besides that, the application must provide a form that allows to add a new car into the inventory. The application should rely on mocked backend responses that you are free to define.

The application's domain model contains a single entity definition, an example is shown below.

```json
{
	"id":"420256c5-3684-414c-904b-6027461cdf5f",
	"make":"Bentley", 
	"model":"Continental GT", 
	"year":"2001"
}
```

Your submission must contain the following artifacts besides the application code:

* A test suite for the frontend application
* A Dockerfile descriptor

# Suggestions for the frontend
* Use TypeScript (Don't need to be strict)
* Develop using NextJS framework
* Use SASS and TailwindCSS for styling
* Use hooks and functional-style code as much as possible
* GraphQL would be a plus

# Submission delivery

Please fork this repository and create a pull request once your submission is ready.
